                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm a passionate and endlessly curious technology enthusiast with a mission to understand everything â€” from the flow of electrons in a circuit to the elegant logic behind code. Whether Iâ€™m soldering components, dissecting memory architectures, or designing
                    user interfaces, I approach each task with wonder, precision, and a desire to learn deeply.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My journey into tech has been anything but shallow. Iâ€™m not content with surface-level knowledge â€” I thrive on nuance, and I ask questions that most people donâ€™t think to ask â€” because thatâ€™s how real understanding begins.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I believe technology is more than just tools and specs â€” itâ€™s a language, and I want to be fluent in every dialect: from backend to bare metal, from front-end finesse to low-level logic. I'm building a foundation that spans hardware and software, design
                    and diagnostics, creativity and computation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm currently growing my skillset across:
                    <ul>
                        <li>ðŸ“š Web development &amp; design</li>
                        <li>âš¡ Electrical systems and PCBs</li>
                        <li>ðŸ§  Computer architecture</li>
                        <li>ðŸ”§ IT fundamentals, including CompTIA certs</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    My goal? To become the kind of technology generalist who can talk semiconductors with an engineer, solve real-world problems with end users, and build systems that are not only functional â€” but beautiful.
                </p>
